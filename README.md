# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

With PySpark, Pandas and SQL we investigate if there is any bias towards favorabble reviews for Vine members.

The Amazon Vine Program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. We received the dataset for Videogames ratings for this specific analysis.

The total number of reviews are 94 (for paid reviews in Vine) and 40471 ( for unpaid non-Vine reviews).
There were also a total of 48 5-star reviews for Vine reviews, and 15663 of 5-star reviews for non-Vine reviews.
We can note that there is a 51% of 5-star reviews that belong to Vine, whereas the non-vine reviews have only 39%. We could speculate that there is a positive bias within the Vine program.
